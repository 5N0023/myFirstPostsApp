This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Hosted on Vercel
[https://my-store-app-sigma.vercel.app/](https://my-store-app-sigma.vercel.app/)


## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Second, create a `.env.local` file with the following contents:

```bash
# .env.local
MONGODB_URI="MONGODB_URI"
TOKEN_SECRET="TOKEN_SECRET"
```


Third, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
